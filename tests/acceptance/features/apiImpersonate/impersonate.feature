Feature: Impersonate

  As a owner,
  I want to impersonate a user,
  So that I can see what they see.

  Background:
    Given the administrator has created following users:
      | username | password | group  | role        |
      | Alice    | Alice    | group1 | user        |
      | Bob      | Bob      | group1 | group-admin |
      | John     | John     | group2 | user        |
      | Harry    | Harry    | group2 | group-admin |
    And user "Alice" has created folder "abcd"
